**Description:**
LRU Cache Visualiser is a small web app that helps you understand how a Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache works. You can add items, access them, and watch how the cache automatically removes the least recently used items when it’s full. This makes learning caching algorithms more interactive and visual.

**Features:**
-> Add items to the cache.
-> Access items to move them to the most recently used position.
-> Automatic eviction of least recently used items.
-> Real-time visual update so you can see how the cache behaves.

**Tech Stack:**
-> HTML — Structure of the visualiser.
-> CSS — Styling and layout.
-> JavaScript — Logic for LRU Cache operations and interactions.

**Demo:**
You can try it live here: **https://gayathrireddynevuri.github.io/LRU-Cache-Visualiser-WebProject/**
